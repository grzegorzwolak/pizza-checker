Hi,
welcome to my project repository. I hope you like the result of my work. Below you will find a link so you can view it conveniently.
During the creation of this site I used:
- HTML, CSS,
- JSX, React.js
- Python
- Selenium

This is my first project in React.js with automated tests.

To run tests enter your localhost address in tests/config.py (URL variable).

It's a simple pizza checker, allowing you to check which pizza you should order.
